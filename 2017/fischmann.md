Haskell is an elegant and fascinating language that has made purely
functional programming practical. This tutorial aims at giving you a
sense of direction in the Haskell eco system. We will explain and
motivate key language concepts and introduce tools and development
techniques as we need them for our examples.

We will start by exploring basic syntax and the Haskell type system in
an interactive Haskell environment. The need to write (slightly)
larger programs will naturally lead us to the Haskell module
system. We will show how to use cabal and the hackage library database
to install packages and create our own.

Key language concepts are hard to pick and will depend on the
interests of the audience. Some candidates are algebraic data types
and pattern matching, polymorphic functions, type classes, monads, GHC
language extensions, or programming with typed holes.

Presentation language will be English, but we are happy to discuss
your questions in German.

### Preparations

Prerequisites: You should install the [Haskell
Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) on your laptop.
Knowledge of Haskell is not required, but a certain aptitude in at
least one other programming language will be helpful.
