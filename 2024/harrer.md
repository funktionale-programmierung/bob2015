Data Science has demonstrated its value in extracting insights from
business data, raising the question: Why not apply these principles to
our software systems’ data? In this talk, I’ll introduce you to the
world of Software Analytics. We’ll explore how to extract valuable
insights from software data by using tools and techniques from data
science to get rid of big, systemic problems in our software systems.

You’ll learn how to leverage scientific thinking, manage the analysis
process, and apply literate statistical programming to analyze
software systems in an understandable way. Or to put it in the words
of software developers: We automate the analysis of large software
systems using open-source tools like Jupyter Notebook, Python, pandas,
jQAssistant, and Neo4j. I’ll also demonstrate through live-coding how
we can gain new insights from data sources like Git repositories,
performance measurements, or source code.

Join me in this session to acquire your starter kit for uncovering
deeply hidden issues and change the way of improving systems with
data-driven software analysis!
