**"(Functional) Domain Modeling"** goes one step further than simply bringing
technical and non-technical experts together via Event Storming or Domain
Storytelling. FDM enables working on the code *collaboratively*.

In this workshop, you will be able to experiment this first hand! You will
engage with Domain Experts, and work out a "runnable" common understanding of
the domain. For this, you will be able to choose your approach: either use
[Clojure's spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) or [the TypeScript's type
system](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html).

In both cases, you will be able to perform invariant enforcement already at
compile time, and domain experts will be able to give feedback directly on the
code.

Marco is an architect and consultant at codecentric and a passionate
advocate of software craft and code quality. He regularly speaks at
well-known conferences and is the author of several technical books.
When he's not buried deep in code, his children play analog board
games with him.

### Leandro Doctors ([GitHub](https://github.com/allentiak) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/leandrodoctors))

Leandro Doctors is a multi-dimensional geek currently based in Berlin. After
discovering the beauty of Functional Programming (and Clojure in particular), he
became simply unable to imagine how a world could ever become beautiful without
Lambda Calculus.

When not dancing Tango or hiking, Leandro dreams in terms of Software Evolution,
Software Quality and Craftspeopleship, the Social Dynamics of Technology Peer
Production, and the Social Impacts of Technology.
