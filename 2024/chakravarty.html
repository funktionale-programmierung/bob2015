When people talk about functional programming in modern multi-paradigm
languages, they usually mention Rust, Scala, or Kotlin. You rarely
hear Swift being mentioned. This is odd, as one might argue that, of
these languages, Swift places the strongest emphasis on functional
programming.

In this talk, I will explain the core functional programming features
of Swift, including its expressive type system, value types, and
mutability control. Furthermore, I will discuss how Swift’s language
design is influenced by the desire to create a language that addresses
the whole spectrum from low-level systems programming up to high-level
applications with sophisticated graphical user interfaces. Beyond the
core language itself, functional programming also permeates Swift’s
rich ecosystem of libraries. To support this point, I will outline
some FP-inspired core libraries, covering concepts from functional
data structures over functional reactive programming to declarative
user interfaces.

Finally, I will briefly summarise practical considerations for using
Swift in your own projects. This includes the cross-platform
toolchain, the package manager, and interoperability with other
languages.

Manuel M T Chakravarty is a researcher and software developer with
interests in programming languages, cryptography, and programming
environments. He developed the interactive development environment
Haskell for Mac — one of the first Swift apps on the Mac App Store. He
is now working on the successor of Haskell for Mac, which leverages
SwiftUI for cross-platform development. His current research work lies
at the intersection of programming languages and cryptography with
applications to open blockchains. Recent contributions cover smart
contract and native asset support for UTxO ledgers, such as Cardano,
as well as multi-party state channels. He has also published
extensively on programming languages, compilers, and high-performance
computing. He contributed to both the design and implementation of the
Haskell programming language (most notably, type families, associated
types, and the foreign function interface) as well as several Haskell
tools and open source libraries. He is currently a functional
programming expert at Tweag and a researcher & architect of smart
contract technology at IOG (formerly, IOHK). Before that he was an
Associate Professor at UNSW Sydney.
